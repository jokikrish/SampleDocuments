        <p style="text-align:justify">Mobile phones are impacted almost all walks of human life. The prominent areas, where the impacts of smartphones are obvious to include business, education, health, and social life. Mobile technology has drastically changed the cultural norms and behavior of individuals. The impacts are both on the positive and negative sides. On the one end smartphones are enabling people to create their own micro-cultures and engage in activities considered dangerous to society and on the other end Smartphone enabling people to remain connected all the time.</p>
        <head><b style="color:blue">Advantage of using Mobile Phones</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Smartphone has created new dimensions for businesses, impact education, health (psychological) and social impact too.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">There are numerous good things about smart mobile phones. Nowadays, there is a separate app for everything whether it's ticket booking or mobile recharge, reading books or access useful documents, etc.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">But the problem is that we remain busy with mobile phones only. We do not have time to go out and play or to meet people rather we prefer playing mobile games or doing video calls. We are building our social network online but are not in contact with anyone.</p>
        <head><b style="color:blue">Disadvantages</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Children are also badly affected using mobile phones. Parents nowadays are giving phones to their kids at a very small age which has more demerits than its benefits. Small kids are also busy on their mom's phone playing their favorite games. This in turn affects their study a lot. I came through a lot of mothers complaining that <b><cite>"My child is unable to perform good at exams. Give him/her some guidance".</cite></b> In return I ask them <b>“ how much time they spend on the phone ?”</b><cite></cite> Answer which I got from a maximum of them was <cite style="color:red"><b>“ They are using my phone more than I do.”</b></cite> According to me these kids have a lot of potentials which should not waste and there should be a strict restriction on using mobile phones after a particular time.</p>
        <head><b style="color:blue">Conclusion</b></head>
        <p style="text-align:justify">It can be concluded that mobile phones are useful provided it is used in a proper way keeping in mind the harmful effects of its overuse.</p>
